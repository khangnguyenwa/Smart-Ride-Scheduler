# Smart-Ride-Scheduler
Smart Ride Scheduler is a mini app that predicts the arrival time of nearby cars based on customer location and selects the most suitable ride, automatically rerouting if the recommended car is delayed. It simulates a smart booking system like Metro Flex with random car positions and speeds.
